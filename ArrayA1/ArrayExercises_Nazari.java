    /*
    R7.24
    In Java, when an array is passed into a function,
    the elements of the array object can be
    manipulated. However, the array variable
    cannot be assigned to a new object which the
    method is trying to do. So this function will
    NOT change the passed array object.

    To fix this, the method should update the
    passed method by changing the elements in
    the array and not try to assign a new
    array into the reference.
