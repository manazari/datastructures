        R8.20
        You cannot create a method that will swap two floating point numbers
        since you can only pass primative types by reference. The closest to
        "swapping" two floating point values is by wrapping the value in a
        class and then having the method swap the two properties of the passed
        in class instances.
    
        R9.11  the primative cast changes the value of the oject while the
        cast to a class changes the type of the reference I guess.

        10.11 Pass in the string.length in an array into the data.average method

        10.12 data.average would take the numerical lexicogical value of each string
        and will take the numerical null value of the object.
