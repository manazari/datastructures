     * TEST IT YOURSELF #1
     * 1. constant

     * 4. constant
     * 5. constant
     * 
     * TEST IT YOURSELF #2
     * 1. For algorithm 1, the number of   questions is always 1. With
     * the other two algorithms, the number of  questions is dependant
     * on the number of people in the room.
     * 
     * 2. Worst case scenario, 1   question is asked for the first algorithm,
     * N number asked in algorithm 2 where N is the number of people, and
     * N^2 people in algorithm 2 where N corrleates to how many
     * people there are
     * 
     * 3. For algorithm 1, it is constant, for algorithm 2 it is linear,
     * and for algorithm 3 it is    quadratic
     * 
     * 
     * TEST IT YOURSELF #3
     * 1. The complexity is N+M and the complexity will become 2N
     * once the second loop is editted
     * 
     * 2. Complexity is N^2 + N
     * 
     * 3. Complexity is N^2 
     * 
     *  TEST IT YOURSELF #4
     * 1. O(N)
     * 2. O(2N)
     * 3. O(N^2)
